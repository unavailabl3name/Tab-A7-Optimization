Hi

I got a Samsung Tab A7 lite for free and I knew it had a bad rep for being a general POS and slow, so I decided to go on a mission to try and root out (haha) every possible optimization
that could be done without root or a custom rom - just using ADB only - the result is this pdf 
my goal was to make it as high performance as possible without breaking anything or sacrificing usability - I think it is working pretty great now 
you use these commands at your own risk - have fun and enjoy and let me know how it goes for you. If you have any other suggestions of things to add, let me know
its by no means a flagship now but i like how it works better now 

I enjoy taking low end stuff and trying to squeeze out every last drop of performance

long version -

System-Level Debloating (via ADB)
Over 80+ preinstalled apps and services removed or disabled, including Samsung bloatware (AR Zone, Samsung Kids, Bixby), Microsoft Office trials, Facebook background services, and redundant Google tools (Meet, YouTube Music, Google TV).

RAM Plus (virtual memory) was explicitly disabled to prevent storage I/O bottlenecks and fake RAM inflation.

Game Optimization Service (GOS) and similar throttling features were disabled to uncap performance.

ðŸ§  Developer Options Tweaks
All animations scaled down or disabled for a faster-feeling UI.

GPU rendering and hardware overlays forced to reduce UI lag.

Background process limits enforced to reduce memory pressure and CPU load.

RAM conservation measures like disabling unnecessary persistent activities were applied.

ðŸ“ˆ Resulting Improvements
Noticeably faster performance with quicker app launches and smoother multitasking.

Lower idle RAM usage, extending headroom for active tasks like Netflix and banking apps.

Battery efficiency boost, thanks to reduced background processing and scanning.

ðŸ§¬ Impact on Lifespan
This streamlined setup reduces wear on internal components by:

Minimizing background activity â†’ less CPU strain and thermal cycling

Reducing disk writes from swap memory â†’ prolongs internal storage life

Improving responsiveness â†’ extends functional lifespan before perceived obsolescence

In short, your Tab A7 Lite has been brought closer to a bare-metal Android experience, tuned specifically for performance, simplicity, and longevity.
